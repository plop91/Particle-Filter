# Particle-Filter

A Particle Filter running on a 2D map for generalized robotics

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of a particle filter running on a 2D map.
I've found particle filters to be a very interesting topic and I wanted to implement one myself that I could use for future projects.

Some interesting features of this particle filter are/will be:
* Ray casting for sensor data (terrible performance, but it works)
* A simple map format that can be easily edited
* Map synthesis from a set of boundaries
* Support for sensors such as LIDAR and cameras
* Support for different types of motion models
* More to come!

## Future Work
* ROS2 integration
